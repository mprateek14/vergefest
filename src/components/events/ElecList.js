			"The robot should follow a track marked with a line with lots of hurdles. On the track, thereâ€™ll be two lines: Start and Finish. Initially, the robot will start from the starting mark and will be considered to have crossed the finishing mark if any part of the robot crosses it. Design a robot, either wired or wireless, within the specified dimensions that can be operated manually or autonomous. It should be able to travel through all the turns of the track. The robot that covers the track within the specified or lesser time will be the winner. Additionally, there will be a Viva/Questionnaire from the evaluation team to analyze your working knowledge and the marks would be added to the final score.",
